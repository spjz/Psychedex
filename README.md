As a test subject, your historic data will be displayed in several viewing modes. There will be a chronological calendar view, where you may filter dates, substances, effects, tags, etc. Keyword searching will be available for all written notes contained in the experience report.

Reports will be presented with two main components. There will be a loosely structured text component, where you may describe the experience however you desire. Each paragraph or section will be labelled according to common periods, such as "preparation", "onset", "peak", "conclusion", and so on.

The other component is the chronological data points, of which there are three types: notes, which permit short comments such as current emotional state, brief observations, or anything really; administrations, which require a material such as a specific chemical compound, some organism, or product, along with the dosage and route; finally there are effects, so any time a user observes some change in perception, they can select it from PW's library, or describe their own, along with a rating of intensity and any comment.

This data will all be aggregated once submitted, such that users may find reports for any substance, or effect, and filter them by many variables, to receive a list of all relevant experiences.

The reliability of experience reports will vary, and the depth of information that each user may decide to record will also vary. I expect that as we accumulate more data, the analytics we produce will become increasingly accurate, as a trend should be apparent for similar doses of some material. Outliers will be easy to identify as they will diverge greatly from the typical report. These can be flagged by enthusiastic users as questionable, and we can then allow users to configure the reliability of reports that they wish to include in their results


So for example, user selects LSD from the psychedex, they see several options: overview, information, experiences, resources, etc.

Overview is the default display (may also be configured which option to show by default), which simply shows an abstract of the substance information, and some lists of experiences filtered by some preconfigured filter (also configurable), resources are a collection of external links. All the data for a substance is user generated, so until the psychedex is filled in, we may prioritise the external references.

If you select information you will see something like psychonautwiki's articles, though the content will be more standardised and expanded to include more sections. Users may submit changes to these sections, and other users may vote to support or dispute the edit. Some threshold of votes is necessary to validate a change, but the history of changes, and any pending are all visible to users who wish to view or vote on them.

The experiences section will be as I described above. It is basically a preset filter for the main experience browser, where the substance is selected already. User may refine the filters in many ways, save their selections, vote on reports, save and share, etc.

Resources will be a user curated list of external websites which contain references to the substance. Again there will be a standard feature supporting filters and search, where in this context, the substance is already selected


Users may configure their privacy settings in their profile. By default your profile is not publicly visible, your reports do not appear in results. You may choose to share your profile, and customise the information which appears in it, such as a username, a display picture, website, etc.

You may also set your reports to public by default, so they will appear in the library, or such that you can only access them with a permalink, so they can be accessed if you share them with somebody, but they do not appear in the library.

Individual reports may also be configured individually to be public or private.

The experience data for all reports will however be used to generate the graphs and analytical results. They will appear in any lists as "private report by anonymous", for example

None of it will be required. There will be a list of standard section titles which we recognise, for example "pharmacology", "chemistry", "discovery", "legal", etc. Users may add these as they desire, and all additions or alterations will require a source and must be approved by peers before becoming publicly visible

This set of events will be aggregated with all reports for a given substance (this can also be aggregated by other variables, such as a specific effect, or something else), and analytical methods will be used to present this data in some meaningful way on a graph or table


We don't need the data analytics feature to be voluminous immediately. It will gradually increase in reliability as more data is collected. One single report is enough to begin showing some graphs and tables though. If you go back and read all my descriptions from tonight you will clearly see that the drug information sections will work effectively like a wiki, and when no information is yet available, the remaining section will be external resource aggregation.

So I suggest we build all the supporting features, and configure clever presets which show the most useful information currently available, and as the thing grows it will become more impressive and attract more user interaction

Privacy is not a concern in my opinion, simply all data is optional for the user to submit, and reports can be private if desired. Detailed documentation will be clearly presented to relieve any paranoia. The system can work as a simple private experience log, or users can contribute to the global analytics project. The main reason I believe this will be successful and extremely useful, is that no such data is possible to collect on academia, for ethical and legal reasons

I think a user should be able to secure their profile with a private key, and perhaps grant access to it by others' authorised public keys. Other users may be happy with a simple pass phrase. Others will be ok with anonymous public submissions. I want to support as many mechanisms as reasonably possible

Only blog-like aspect of reports will be possible to delist from the library. Timeline data will always be utilised, though not necessarily searchable in relation to the report permalink which the user decides the level of publicity
